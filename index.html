          <div class="title">What is Pokerbots?</div>
          <div class="text">6.176, or MIT Pokerbots, is a computerized poker tournament. Teams have one month to program a completely autonomous pokerbot to compete against other teams.</div>
          <div class="text">Competitors must learn and apply concepts in economics, mathematics, and computer science not normally developed together in academic settings in order to conquere their opponents and emerge victorious.</div>
          <div class="text">This year's competition features over $25,000 in prizes and attention from the most prestigious technology and trading firms. This IAP, channel your programming ability and strategic quantitative thinking skills to become the reigning Pokerbots champion!</div>

              <h2>Why Poker?</h2>
              <p>As a game of incomplete information and uncertainty, poker is a prime application of the game theory concepts and decision making skills essential to trading. While traders make risk decisions based on the limited information they get from the markets, poker players make decisions based on hidden information as well, taking into account factors such as expected value and probability distributions.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, poker is a widely known game that has become a cultural phenomenon in recent years and it is extremely popular on college campuses. This keeps the game accessible to bright minds with the requisite skills to succeed as traders.</p>

            <div class="column">
              <h2>I thought this was a programming competition? What language is it in?</h2>
              <p>It is! To build a working pokerbot only requires both critical thinking ability and an eagerness to learn. However, an understanding of machine learning, algorithms and data mining can go a long way towards creating an advanced pokerbot. The competitors can choose to code in either C++, Python, or Java.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h2>Machine Learning? Algorithms? Exactly how much coding experience is necessary?</h2>
              <p>We are welcoming students with all levels of programming experience. Nevertheless, some previous coding experience would certainly be helpful. Although not necessary, we recommend you have at least one team member with some programming experience.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <h2>What form of poker will it be?</h2>
              <p>We are keeping the game and tournament structure secret. You will hear all about it during the challenge unveiling in early January, 2019.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h2>How many members can make up a team?</h2>
              <p>Teams may be composed of 1 - 4 players.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <h2>How do I receive course credit?</h2>
              <p>You will need to submit functioning pokerbots for various checkpoints throughout the course, as well as a short strategy report at the end of IAP.</p>

              <h2>Do I have to be an MIT student to participate?</h2>
              <p>For our course and tournament in January, you must be able to register for MIT IAP classes. If you are cross registering, bring your papers in on the first day of class for us to sign.</p>

            <div class="column">
              <h2>How do I register?</h2>
              <p>IAP pre-registration will open in December!</p>

            <div class="column">
              <h2>How much time will it take to make a pokerbot?</h2>
              <p>Creating a functioning pokerbot takes no time at all. However, creating a competitive and strategic pokerbot will require more effort and experimentation. Ultimately, the more you put into your pokerbot, the more value you will receive from the class!</p>
