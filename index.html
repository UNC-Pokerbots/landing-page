                </h1>
                <p>6.176, or MIT Pokerbots, is a computerized poker tournament. Teams have one month to program a completely autonomous pokerbot to compete against other teams.
                </p>
                <p>Competitors must learn and apply concepts in economics, mathematics, and computer science not normally developed together in academic settings in order to conquer their opponents and emerge victorious.
                </p>
                <p>This year's competition features over $30,000 in prizes and attention from the most prestigious technology and trading firms. This IAP, channel your programming ability and strategic quantitative thinking skills to become the reigning Pokerbots champion!

                    <h2>Why Poker?
                    </h2>
                    <p>As a game of incomplete information and uncertainty, poker is a prime application of the game theory 
                      concepts and decision making skills essential to trading. While traders make risk decisions based on the 
                      limited information they get from the markets, poker players make decisions based on hidden information as 
                      well, taking into account factors such as expected value and probability distributions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, poker is a widely known game that has become a cultural phenomenon in recent years and it is
                      extremely popular on college campuses. This keeps the game accessible to bright minds with the requisite 
                      skills to succeed as traders.

                    <h2>Wait, I thought this was a programming competition? What language is it in?
                    </h2>
                    <p>It is! To build a working pokerbot only requires both critical thinking ability and an eagerness to learn.
                      However,  an understanding of machine learning, algorithms and data mining can go a long way towards 
                      creating an advanced pokerbot. The competitors can choose to code in either C++, Python, or Java.

                    <h2>Machine Learning? Algorithms? Gulp. So exactly how much coding experience is necessary?
                    </h2>
                    <p>We are welcoming students with all levels of programming experience. Nevertheless, some previous coding 
                      experience would certainly be helpful. Although not necessary, we recommend you have at least one team 
                      member with some programming experience.

                      simple task. You should view this as taking a class. To be competitive in the tournaments will require 
                      even more time. Nobody said it would be easy, but we will try our best to help along the way.
